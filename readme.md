## Usage

To create a new mobile app project using this template as an Expo template, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Expo project based on this template using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx create-expo-app my-new-app --template expo-router-redux-template
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn create expo-app my-new-app --template expo-router-redux-template
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-new-app
    ```

3. To launch your app and run it on an emulator, physical device, or web browser, start the Expo development server using one of the following commands:

    - For Android:

        ```bash
        yarn android
        ```

    - For iOS:

        ```bash
        yarn ios
        ```

    - For web development:
        ```bash
        yarn web
        ```

These commands will initiate the Expo development server and allow you to preview and test your app on different platforms.

You can then begin customizing the template to suit your project's requirements. Refer to the project structure and comments in the code for guidance.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React Native and Expo Router project layout, with folders for components, screens, Redux slices, and more. Here's a brief overview:

-   `app`: Contains layouts, and screens or routes for your app.
-   `assets`: Static assets like images and fonts.
-   `components`: Reusable UI components.
-   `constants`: Contains Colors, Dimensions, Fonts, and any other constants.
